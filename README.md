# TDT4173 Solar panel energy production

This was a project related to the course TDT4173 at NTNU. The task was to use machine learning models and techniques to predict how much energy solar panels would produce based on weather data. We did a lot of exploratory data analysis and explored with several different machine learning models. This is my first experience with machine learning models for solving real-world problems.
